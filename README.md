## About this project ðŸš€

I Created this new Flutter app as part of my journey to learn Flutter. The app is designed to generate cool-sounding names, like "newstay," "lightstream," "mainbrake," or "graypine." Users can request the next name, favorite the current one, and review their list of favorited names on a separate page. Additionally, the app is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.
